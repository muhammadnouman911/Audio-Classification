# ðŸŽµ **Audio Classification with Machine Learning**

Welcome to the **Audio Classification** repository! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify audio files into various categories based on their features. Whether you're a beginner in audio processing or a seasoned machine learning enthusiast, this repo provides a detailed pipeline to classify sounds effectively.

## ðŸ”¥ **Features**

* **Audio Feature Extraction**: Automatically extracts key audio features such as MFCC, chroma, and spectral contrast to understand the unique characteristics of sound.
* **Classification Pipeline**: Build and train models to classify audio into predefined categories, using datasets like ESC-50.
* **Google Colab Integration**: Effortlessly run the project on Google Colab with ready-to-execute notebooks.
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your model's performance with advanced metrics and visualizations.

## ðŸ—‚ **Repository Structure**

* **`Audio_Features_Checking.ipynb`**: Dive into the audio data and check the extracted features, a crucial step to understand your data before feeding it into models.
* **`Classification_ESC_50.ipynb`**: The heart of the projectâ€”train, evaluate, and fine-tune the audio classification model using the ESC-50 dataset.
* **`README.md`**: You're reading it! Documentation to guide you through the project.

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
