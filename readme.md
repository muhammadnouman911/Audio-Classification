# ðŸŽµ **Audio Classification with Machine Learning**

Welcome to the **Audio Classification** repository! This project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify audio files into various categories based on their features. Whether you're a beginner in audio processing or a seasoned machine learning enthusiast, this repo provides a detailed pipeline to classify sounds effectively.

## ðŸ”¥ **Features**

* **Audio Feature Extraction**: Automatically extracts key audio features such as MFCC, chroma, and spectral contrast to understand the unique characteristics of sound.
* **Classification Pipeline**: Build and train models to classify audio into predefined categories, using datasets like ESC-50.
* **Google Colab Integration**: Effortlessly run the project on Google Colab with ready-to-execute notebooks.
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your model's performance with advanced metrics and visualizations.

## ðŸ—‚ **Repository Structure**

* **`Audio_Features_Checking.ipynb`**: Dive into the audio data and check the extracted features, a crucial step to understand your data before feeding it into models.
* **`Classification_ESC_50.ipynb`**: The heart of the projectâ€”train, evaluate, and fine-tune the audio classification model using the ESC-50 dataset.
* **`README.md`**: You're reading it! Documentation to guide you through the project.

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadmadnouman911/Audio-Classification.git
   ```

2. **Run on Google Colab:**

   The project is set up for seamless integration with Google Colab. Simply open the notebooks on Colab to begin working right away:

   * [Audio\_Features\_Checking.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/)
   * [Classification\_ESC\_50.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## ðŸ§© **Installation**

To run the notebooks locally, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas librosa scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## ðŸ”¨ **How to Use**

1. **Feature Extraction**: Open the `Audio_Features_Checking.ipynb` notebook to load your audio data and extract essential features.
2. **Model Training**: After extracting features, proceed to the `Classification_ESC_50.ipynb` notebook to build and train the classification model.
3. **Test Your Model**: Evaluate your model on the test set and see the accuracy with visualizations.
4. **Classify New Audio**: Use the trained model to predict the class of new, unseen audio files.
